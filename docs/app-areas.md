The <a href="../index">introduction</a> and the <a href="../agent-oriented-development">agent-oriented development guide</a> together present a picture of the kinds of solution an agent-based approach makes possible, and the types of environment they are most suited for. In short, this is where:

  * the environment is decentralised,
  * involves multiple stakeholders, and
  * is inhabited by AEAs representing the different stakeholders who:
    * interact autonomously, and
    * communicate with one another directly via a peer-to-peer network. 

In light of those discussions, on this page we identify a number of application areas for AEA-based solutions. This list is by no means comprehensive. In fact, we are most excited about applications which we have not thought of before.

* **Inhabitants**: agents representing objects in the IoT (Internet of Things) space. For examples, AEAs paired with real world hardware devices such as drones, laptops, heat sensors, etc. An example is a <a href="../thermometer-skills"> thermometer agent </a>.
* **Interfaces**: facilitation agents which provide the necessary API interfaces for interaction between existing (Web 2.0) and new (Web 3.0) economic models. An example is an AEA with <a href="../http-connection-and-skill"> HTTP connection and skill </a> who has the capability to communicate using HTTP.
* **Pure software**: software agents _living_ in the digital space that interact with interface agents and others.
* **Digital data sales agents**: software agents that attach to data sources and sell it via the open economic framework. An example can be found <a href="../ml-skills">here</a>.
* **Representative**: an agent which represents an individual's activities on the Fetch.ai network. An example can be found <a href="../tac-skills">here</a>.

## Likely short-term applications

In the short-term we see AEAs primarily deployed in three areas:

* Off-load repetitive tasks: AEAs can automate well-defined processes in different domains such as supply chain, mobility and finance, etc.

* Micro transactions: AEAs make it economically viable to execute trades which involve small value transfers. This is particularly relevant in areas where there is a (data) supply side constituted of many small actors and a single demand side.

* Wallet agents: AEAs can simplify interactions with blockchains for end users. For instance, they can act as "smart wallets" which optimize blockchain interactions on behalf of the user.


## Multi-agent system versus agent-based modelling

The multi-agent systems enabled by the AEA framework are technological agent-based solutions to real problems and, although there are some overlap, the framework is not designed from the outset to be used as an agent-based modelling software where the goal is scientific behavioural observation rather than practical economic gain.

Moreover, there is no restriction to *multi*; single-agent applications are also supported.
