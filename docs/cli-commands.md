!!! tip 
    You can also disable a resource without deleting it by removing the entry from the configuration but leaving the package in the skills namespace.

!!! tip 
    You can skip the consistency checks on the AEA project by using the flag `--skip-consistency-check`. E.g. `aea --skip-consistency-check run` will bypass the fingerprint checks.
