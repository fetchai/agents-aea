# ACN Internals

The aim of this document is to describe at a high-level the main implementation of the Agent Communication Network (ACN).

In particular:

- the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/libs/go/libp2p_node" target="_blank">`libp2p_node` Golang library</a>;
- the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/packages/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p" target="_blank">`p2p_libp2p` AEA connection</a> written in Python, that implements the **direct connection** with an ACN peer;
- the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/packages/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p_client" target="_blank">`p2p_libp2p_client` AEA connection</a> written in Python, which implements the **delegate connection** with an ACN peer.

It is assumed the reader already knows what is the ACN and its purposes; if not, we suggest reading <a href="../acn">this page</a>.

This documentation page is structured as follows:

- Firstly, the ACN protocol is described: all the messages and data structures involved, as well as some example of interaction protocol with these messages;
- Then, it is explained how a peer can join an existing ACN network, and the message exchange involved;
- It follows the description of the journey of an envelope in the ACN network: from the agent connection to its contact peer, between ACN peers, and then from the contact peer of the destination agent to the target agent;
- The following section describes the functionalities of the AEA connections that allow to communicate through the ACN: `fetchai/p2p_libp2p` and `fetchia/p2p_libp2p_delegate`;
- The documentation ends with a section of known issues and limitations of the current implementation.

## Messages and Data Structures

At the foundation of the ACN there is the _ACN protocol_. The protocol messages and the reply structure are generated from this <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/blob/develop/libs/go/libp2p_node/protocols/acn/v1_0_0/acn.yaml" target="_blank">protocol specification</a>, using the <a href="../protocol-generator" target="_blank">protocol generator</a>. Therefore, it uses <a href="https://protobuf.dev" target="_blank">Protocol Buffers</a> as a serialization format, and the definition of the data structures involved is defined in this <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/blob/develop/libs/go/libp2p_node/protocols/acn/v1_0_0/acn.proto" target="_blank">`.proto` file</a>.

To know more about the protocol generator, refer to the relevant section of the documentation: <a href="../protocol-generator" target="_blank">Protocol Generator</a>.

### Agent Record

An _agent record_ is a data structure containing information about an agent and its Proof-of-Representation (PoR) to be used by a peer for other peers. This data structure is used as a payload in other ACN messages (see below).

The `AgentRecord` data structure contains the following fields:

- `service_id`: a string describing the service identifier.
- `ledger_id`: a string. It is the identifier of the ledger this agent record is associated to. Currently, the allowed values are:
    - `fetchai`, the identifier for the Fetch.AI ledger;
    - `ethereum`, the identifier for the Ethereum ledger;
    - `cosmos`, the identifier for the Cosmos ledger;
- `address`: a string. It is the public key of a public-private key pair. It is used as an identifier for routing purposes.
- `public_key`: a string. The representative's public key. Used in case of (PoR).
- `peer_public_key`: a string. The public key of the peer.
- `signature`: a string. The signature for PoR.
- `not_before`: a string. Specify the lower bound for certificate validity. If it is a string, it must follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. It will be interpreted as time zone UTC-0
- `not_after`: a string. Specify the upper bound for certificate validity. If it is a string, it must follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. It will be interpreted as time zone UTC-0.

### ACN Message

Entities in the ACN (i.e. either agents or peers) exchange _ACN messages_. An ACN message contains a `payload` field, which is the actual content of the message.

There are different types of payloads:

- `Status`
- `Register`
- `LookupRequest`
- `LookupResponse`
- `AeaEnvelope`

### Status

The `Status` payload is used as a response message to inform the sender about the handling of certain requests. The payload contains:

- the `status_code`, a positive integer among the ones in the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/blob/develop/libs/go/libp2p_node/protocols/acn/v1_0_0/acn.proto" target="_blank">Protobuf file</a>.
- a list of error messages (string).

A status code `0`, identified as `SUCCESS`, means that the request has been processed successfully. Status codes greater than `0` can be:

- Generic errors: errors that occur under generic circumstances.

    - `ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, with integer value `1`: the receiver of the message does not support the protocol version of the sender;
    - `ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD`, with integer value `2`: the payload could not be deserialized on the receiver side;
    - `ERROR_GENERIC`, with integer value `3`: an internal error;
    - `ERROR_SERIALIZATION`, with integer value `4`: a serialization error occurred on the receiving end;

- Register errors: errors that occur during agent registration operations in the ACN.

    - `ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS`, with integer value `10`: the PoR by a peer from another peer does not match the destination address of the envelope to be routed by the receiving peer.
    - `ERROR_WRONG_PUBLIC_KEY`, with integer value `11`: the representative peer public key does not match the one in the agent record;
    - `ERROR_INVALID_PROOF`, with integer value `12`: the signature is invalid;
    - `ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_LEDGER`, with integer value `13`: the ledger of the PoR is not supported by the peer;

- Lookup and delivery errors: errors that occur during lookup to the DHT and envelope delivery operations in the ACN.

    - `ERROR_UNKNOWN_AGENT_ADDRESS`, with integer value `20`: the requested agent address has not been found in the local DHT of the peer;
    - `ERROR_AGENT_NOT_READY`, with integer value `21`: the agent is not ready for envelope delivery.

### Register

The `Register` payload is used to request a peer to register an agent among his known ones. The payload contains the field `record`, which is an instance of `AgentRecord`.

### LookupRequest

The `LookupRequest` payload is sent between peer to look-up addresses in the Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It contains the agent address (a string) that the sender needs to correctly route an envelope.

### LookupResponse

The `LookupResponse` payload is the response sent by a peer that received a `LookupRequest`. It contains the `AgentRecord` associated to the requested address.

### AeaEnvelope

The `AeaEnvelope` payload contains the envelope sent by an agent and to be delivered to another agent. It contains:

- `envelope`: the envelope to be forwarded, in byte representation;
- an `AgentRecord` (see above).

## ACN Protocol Interactions

The ACN protocol specifies three different possible interactions:

- the _registration_ interaction
- the _look-up_ interaction
- the _routing_ interaction

### "Registration" Interaction

The registration interaction is used by delegate agents or relayed peers to register themselves to another peer.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Agent/RelayedPeer
        participant Peer
        Agent/RelayedPeer->>Peer: Register(AgentRecord)
        alt success
            note over Peer: check PoR
            Peer->>Agent/RelayedPeer: Status(SUCCESS)
        else wrong agent address
            Peer->>Agent/RelayedPeer: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
        else wrong public key
            Peer->>Agent/RelayedPeer: Status(ERROR_WRONG_PUBLIC_KEY)
        else invalid proof of representation
            Peer->>Agent/RelayedPeer: Status(ERROR_INVALID_PROOF)
        else unsupported ledger
            Peer->>Agent/RelayedPeer: Status(ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_LEDGER)
        end
```

### "Look-up" Interaction

The look-up interaction is used by a peer to request information to another peer about an agent address.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Peer1
        participant Peer2
        Peer1->>Peer2: LookupRequest(address)
        alt success
            Peer2->>Peer1: LookupResponse(AgentRecord)
        else unknown agent address
            Peer2->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_UNKNOWN_AGENT_ADDRESS)
        end
```

### "Routing" Interaction

The routing interaction is used by agents and peers to route the envelope through the ACN.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Peer1
        participant Peer2
        Peer1->>Peer2: AeaEnvelope(envelope, AgentRecord)
        alt success
            note over Peer2: check PoR
            Peer2->>Peer1: Status(SUCCESS)
        else error on decoding of Envelope payload
            Peer2->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        else PoR errors
            note over Peer1,Peer2: see above
        end
```

## Joining the ACN network

When an ACN peer wants to join the network, it has to start from a list of _bootstrap peers_, i.e. a list of ACN peers to connect with (at least one).

Each node handles four different types of <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/stream-multiplexing/" target="_blank">libp2p streams</a>:

- the _notification stream_, identified by the URI `/aea-notif/`: this stream is used by new peers to notify their existence to
- the _address stream_, identified by the URI `/aea-address/`: used to send look-up requests and look-up responses;
- the _envelope stream_, identified by the URI `/aea/`: used to forward and to receive ACN envelopes;
- the _register relay stream_, identified by the URI `/aea-register/`: this is to receive messages from clients that want to register their agents addresses; this peer, and then it can register their addresses.

To begin with, the node process initializes the transport connections with the bootstrap peers, the local copy of the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), the persistent storage for agent records, and performs other non-functional operations like setting up the <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> Prometheus monitoring system</a>. Optionally, can also start listening for relay connections and delegate connections.

Then, it sets up the notification stream and notifies the bootstrap peers (if any).

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Peer1
        participant Peer2
        participant Peer3
        note over Peer1: notify<br/>bootstrap peers
        Peer1->>Peer2: notify
        Peer2->>Peer2: wait until notifying peer <br/>added to DHT
        activate Peer2
        Peer1->>Peer3: notify
        Peer3->>Peer3: wait until notifying peer <br/>added to DHT
        activate Peer3
        note over Peer2,Peer3: Peer1 registered to DHT
        deactivate Peer2
        deactivate Peer3
        loop for each local/relay/delegate address
            Peer1->>Peer1: compute CID from address
            Peer1->>Peer2: register address
            Peer1->>Peer3: register address
        end
        note over Peer1: set up:<br/>- address stream<br/>- envelope stream<br/>- register relay stream
```

### Relay Connections

If the ACN node is configured to run the relay service, it sets up the register relay stream, waiting for registration requests.

The following diagram shows an example of the message exchanged during a registration request:

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Agent
        participant Peer
        Agent->>Peer: Register
        alt decoding error of ACN message
            Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        else wrong payload
            Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD)
        else PoR check fails
            alt wrong agent address
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            else unsupported ledger
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_LEDGER)
            else agent address and public key don't match
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            else invalid proof
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_INVALID_PROOF)
            end
        else PoR check succeeds
            Peer->>Agent: Status(SUCCESS)
            note over Peer: announce agent address<br/>to other peers
        end
```

### Delegate Connections

If the ACN node is configured to run the delegate service, it starts listening from a TCP socket at a configurable URI.

To see a diagram of the message exchanged during a registration request read <a href="../acn-internals#registration-interaction" target="_blank">this section</a>.

## ACN Transport

In the following sections, we describe the main three steps of the routing of an envelope through the ACN:

- _ACN entrance_: when an envelope sent by an agent enters the peer-to-peer network via the peer the agent is connected to i.e. agent-to-peer communication;
- _ACN routing_: when an envelope gets routed through the peer-to-peer network, i.e. peer-to-peer communication;
- _ACN exit_: when an envelope gets delivered to the receiving agent through its representative peer, i.e. peer-to-agent communication.

### ACN Envelope Entrance: Agent -> Peer

In this section, we will describe the interaction protocols between agents and peers for the messages sent by the agent to the ACN network; in particular, the communication from the contact peer of an agent to the agent.

The following diagram explains the exchange of messages on entering an envelope in the ACN.

In the case of _direct connection_, `Agent` is a Python process, whereas `Peer` is in a separate (Golang) process. The logic of the Python Agent client is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/packages/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p" target="_blank">AEA connection `fetchai/p2p_libp2p`</a> The communication between `Agent` and `Peer` is done through an OS pipe for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between the AEA's process and the libp2p node process; then, the message gets enqueued to an output queue by an input coroutine. Finally, the envelope ends up in an output queue, which is processed by an output coroutine and routed to the next peer.

In the case of _delegate connection_, the message exchange is very similar; however, instead of using pipes, the communication is done through the network, i.e. TCP, with a peer which has the delegate service enabled. The logic of the `Agent` client connected with a delegate connection is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/packages/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p_client" target="_blank">AEA connection `fetchai/p2p_libp2p_client`</a>

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Agent
        participant Peer
        loop until Status(success) received
            Agent->>Peer: AeaEnvelope
            Agent->>Agent: wait
            note left of Agent: Wait until<br/>Status(success)
            alt successful case
                Peer->>Agent: Status(success)
                note over Agent: break loop
            else ack-timeout OR conn-error
                note left of Agent: continue: Try to<br/>resend/reconnect
            else version not supported
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION)
            else error on decoding of ACN message
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
            else error on decoding of Envelope payload
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
            else the payload cannot be handled
                Peer->>Agent: Status(ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD)
            end
        end
        note over Peer: route envelope<br/>to next peer
```

### ACN Envelope Routing

In this section, we describe the interaction between peers when it comes to envelope routing.

Assume an envelope arrives from an agent to peer `Peer1`, i.e. `Peer1` is the first hop of the routing. Let `Agent` be the local agent directly connected to `Peer1`, `Peer2` a direct peer of peer `Peer1`.

When the envelope is leaving `Peer1`, we may have different scenario:

1. In case of direct connection, and the field `sender` of the envelope is not the local agent address: the message is considered invalid, and it is dropped.

    ``` mermaid
        sequenceDiagram
            participant Agent
            participant Peer1
            participant Peer2
            Agent->>Peer1: AeaEnvelope
            alt envelope sender not registered locally
                note over Peer1: stop, log error
            end
    ```

2. the `target` of the envelope is the local agent connected to the peer: the envelope is routed to the local agent.

    ``` mermaid
        sequenceDiagram
            participant Agent
            participant Peer1
            participant Peer2
            Agent->>Peer1: AeaEnvelope
            alt target == peer1.my_agent
                note over Peer1: envelope destinated<br/> to local agent,<br/> not routing
                loop agent not ready
                    note over Peer1: sleep for 100ms
                end
                Peer1->>Agent: AeaEnvelope
                Agent->>Peer1: Status(Success)
            end
    ```

3. the `target` is a delegate client. Send the envelope via TCP.

    ``` mermaid
        sequenceDiagram
            participant Delegate
            participant Peer1
            participant Peer2
            Delegate->>Peer1: AeaEnvelope
            alt destination is a delegate
                note over Peer1: send envelope<br/> to delegate via TCP
                Peer1->>Delegate: AeaEnvelope
                Delegate->>Peer1: Status(Success)
            end
    ```

4. Otherwise, look up the local DHT. If an entry is found, use it; otherwise, send a look-up request to connected peers.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Agent
        participant Peer1
        participant Peer2
        Agent->>Peer1: AeaEnvelope
        alt address found in DHT
            note over Peer1: destination is a<br/>relay client
        else lookup address in DHT
            note over Peer1: send lookup request<br/> to all peers
            Peer1->>Peer2: LookupRequest
            alt generic error
                Peer2->>Peer1: Status(GENERIC_ERROR)
            else look-up response
                Peer2->>Peer1: LookupResponse
                note over Peer1: Check PoR
            else not found
                Peer2->>Peer1:Status(UNKNOWN_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            end
        end
        note over Peer1,Peer2: Now Peer1 knows the contact peer<br/>is PeerX
```

In particular, when a peer receives a LookupRequest message, it does the following:

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Peer1
        participant Peer2
        Peer1->>Peer2: LookupRequest
        alt error
            Peer2->>Peer1: Status(Error)
        else local agent/relay/delegate
            note over Peer2: requested address is<br/>a local agent<br/>OR<br/>requested address is<br/>in my relay clients<br/>OR<br/>requested address is<br/>in my delegate clients
            Peer2->>Peer1: LookupResponse
            note over Peer1: Check PoR
        else not found locally
            note over Peer2: send lookup request<br/>to other peers...
            alt found
                Peer2->>Peer1: LookupResponse
                note over Peer1: Check PoR
            else not found
                Peer2->>Peer1:Status(UNKNOWN_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            end
        end
```

Let `Peer3` the contact peer of the recipient of the envelope. The following diagram shows how the contact peer of the envelope recipient handles the incoming envelope:

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Peer1
        participant Peer3
        Peer1->>Peer3: AeaEnvelope
        alt decoding error of ACN message
            Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        else unexpected payload
            Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD)
        else decoding error of envelope payload
            Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        else PoR check fails
            alt wrong agent address
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            else unsupported ledger
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_LEDGER)
            else agent address and public key don't match
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            else invalid proof
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_INVALID_PROOF)
            end
        else PoR check succeeds
            alt target is delegate, not ready
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_AGENT_NOT_READY)
            else exists delegate, ready
                note over Peer3: forward envelope via<br/>delegate connection
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(SUCCESS)
            else target is local agent, not ready
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_AGENT_NOT_READY)
            else target is local agent, ready
                note over Peer3: forward envelope via<br/>direct connection
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(SUCCESS)
            else agent does not exist
                Peer3->>Peer1: Status(ERROR_UNKNOWN_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            end
        end
```

### ACN Envelope Exit: Peer -> Agent

The following diagram explains the exchange of messages on exiting an envelope in the ACN. That is, the communication from the contact peer of an agent to the agent.

The same message exchange is done both in the case of direct connection and delegate connection, similarly for what has been described for the envelope entrance <a href="../acn-internals#acn-envelope-entrance-agent-peer">(see above)</a>.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Agent
        participant Peer
        Peer->>Agent: AeaEnvelope
        alt successful case
            Agent->>Peer: Status(success)
        else ack-timeout OR conn-error
            note left of Peer: do nothing
        else error on decoding of ACN message
            Agent->>Peer: Status(GENERIC_ERROR)
        else error on decoding of Envelope payload
            Agent->>Peer: Status(GENERIC_ERROR)
        else wrong payload
            Agent->>Peer: Status(GENERIC_ERROR)
        end
```

## Connect your AEA to the ACN

To connect the AEA to the ACN network, there are two AEA connections available:

- the `fetchai/p2p_libp2p`, that implements a direct connection, and
- the `fetchai/p2p_libp2p_delegate` connection, that implements the delegate connection.

For more information on the AEA connection package type, refer to <a href="../connection/" target="_blank">this guide</a>.

### The `fetchai/p2p_libp2p` Connection

The source code of the `fetchai/p2p_libp2p` connection can be downloaded from <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/fetchai/p2p_libp2p/latest" target="_blank">the AEA Registry</a>, or from <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/packages/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p" target="_blank">the main AEA framework repository.</a>

The package provides the connection class `P2PLibp2pConnection`, which implements the `Connection` interface and therefore can be used by the Multiplexer as any other connection.

- The `connect` method of this connection spawns a new instance of the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/blob/main/libs/go/libp2p_node/libp2p_node.go" target="_blank">`libp2p_node` program</a> (i.e. an ACN peer node) and connects to it through OS pipes. Then, it sets up the _message receiving loop_, which enqueues messages in the input queue to be read by `read` method calls, and the _message sending loop_, which dequeues messages from the output queue and forwards them to the Libp2p node. The loops are run concurrently in the Multiplexer thread, using the Python asynchronous programming library `asyncio`.

        Libp2p Connection->>sending loop: start recv loop

        activate receiving loop
        deactivate Libp2p Node
        deactivate sending loop
        deactivate receiving loop
```

- The `send` method enqueues a message in the output queue. The message is then dequeued by the sending loop, and then sent to the Libp2p node.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Libp2p Connection
        participant sending loop
        participant Libp2p Node
        activate sending loop
        Libp2p Connection->>Libp2p Connection: enqueue message to output queue
        sending loop->>sending loop: dequeue message from output queue
        deactivate sending loop
        sending loop->>Libp2p Node: AeaEnvelope
        sending loop->>sending loop: wait for status
        activate sending loop
        alt success
            note over Libp2p Node: route envelope
            Libp2p Node->>sending loop: Status(SUCCESS)
            deactivate sending loop
            note over sending loop: OK
        else timed out
            note over sending loop: raise with error
        else acn message decoding error
            Libp2p Node->>sending loop: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        else unexpected payload
            Libp2p Node->>sending loop: Status(ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD)
        else envelope decoding error
            Libp2p Node->>sending loop: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        end
```

- The `receive` method dequeues a message from the input queue. The queue is populated by the receiving loop, which receives messages from the Libp2p node.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Libp2p Connection
        participant receiving loop
        participant Libp2p Node
        activate receiving loop
        Libp2p Node->>receiving loop: AeaEnvelope
        deactivate receiving loop
        Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Node: wait for status
        activate Libp2p Node
        alt success
            note over receiving loop: enqueue envelope<br/>to input queue
            receiving loop->>Libp2p Node: Status(SUCCESS)
            deactivate Libp2p Node
            note over receiving loop: OK
        else timed out
            note over Libp2p Node: ignore
        else acn message decoding error
            receiving loop->>Libp2p Node: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        else unexpected payload
            receiving loop->>Libp2p Node: Status(ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD)
        else envelope decoding error
            receiving loop->>Libp2p Node: Status(ERROR_SERIALIZATION)
        end
        Libp2p Connection->>receiving loop: read message from output queue
        note over Libp2p Connection: return message<br/>to Multiplexer
```

- the `disconnect` method stops both the receiving loop and the sending loop, and stops the Libp2p node.

### The `fetchai/p2p_libp2p_delegate` Connection

The source code of the `fetchai/p2p_libp2p_delegate` connection can be downloaded from <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/fetchai/p2p_libp2p_client/latest" target="_blank">the main AEA framework repository.</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/tree/main/packages/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p_client" target="_blank">the main AEA framework repository.</a>

The package provides the connection class `P2PLibp2pClientConnection`, which implements the `Connection` interface and therefore can be used by the Multiplexer as any other connection.

- The `connect` method of this connection will set up a TCP connection to the URI of the delegate peer. Then, it will send a `Register` request to register the agent among the peer's client connections. On registration success, it sets up the _message receiving loop_, which enqueues messages in the input queue to be read by read method calls, and the _message sending loop_, which dequeues messages from the output queue and forwards them to the Libp2p node. The loops are run concurrently in the Multiplexer thread, using the Python asynchronous programming library `asyncio`.

``` mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Libp2p Client Connection
        participant Libp2p Node
        activate Libp2p Node
        Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Node: listening for TCP connections
        Libp2p Client Connection->>Libp2p Node: Register (via TCP)
        deactivate Libp2p Node
        alt decoding error of ACN message

        else wrong payload
            Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Client Connection: Status(ERROR_UNEXPECTED_PAYLOAD)
        else PoR check fails
            alt wrong agent address
                Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Client Connection: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            else unsupported ledger
                Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Client Connection: Status(ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_LEDGER)
            else agent address and public key don't match
                Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Client Connection: Status(ERROR_WRONG_AGENT_ADDRESS)
            else invalid proof
                Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Client Connection: Status(ERROR_INVALID_PROOF)
            end
        else PoR check succeeds
            Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Client Connection: Status(SUCCESS)
            note over Libp2p Node: announce agent<br/>address to<br/>other peers
            Libp2p Node->>Libp2p Node: wait data from socket
            activate Libp2p Node
            deactivate Libp2p Node
        end
```

- The `send` method and the `receive` methods behave similarly to the `send` and `receive` methods of the <a href="../acn-internals#the-fetchaip2p_libp2p-connection" target="_blank">`p2p_libp2p connection`</a>, in terms of message exchange; however, the communication is done via TCP rather than pipes.

- The `disconnect` method interrupts the connection with the delegate peer, without explicitly unregistering.

## Known Issues and Limitations

In this section, we provide a list of known issues and limitations of the current implementation of the ACN, considering both the ACN nodes (written in Golang) and the AEA connections, for the Python AEA framework, to interact with them.

### Delegate Client on Client Disconnection/Reconnection

In case of disconnection/reconnection, delegate client record will be removed. This can cause two problems: either the delegate client is not found, or connection is closed during the send operation.

Possible solutions:

- Create more complicated structure for clients storage;
- Keep the delegate client record for longer;
- Clean up the record by timeout, per client queues.

### Golang Node <> Python Client `libp2p` Connection

In case of connection between the Golang side (i.e. ACN node) and the Python side (i.e. the `libp2p` AEA connection) is broken, there is no reconnection attempt. The Golang side connect to the Python server opened, but if the connection is broken Golang can try to reconnect; however, the Python side does not know about this and will restart the node completely.

Possible solutions: the problem requires updates on both sides and assume possible timeouts on broken connection. If connection is broken, the Python side awaits for reconnection from Golang side, and restart node completely after timeout.

### What a Peer Should Do if it Receives an Acknowledgement with an Error?

If an ACN response is the `Status` with error code different from `SUCCESS`, the forwarding to other peers is not repeated.

A possible solution is to resend the message; however, not clear why it should help in case of healthy connection, how many times the sender should retry, and how it would help.

### No Possibility of Switching Peers

In case of a peer becoming unavailable, a delegate client or relay client currently has no means to automatically switch the peer. In particular, the DHT should be updated when a client switches peers.
