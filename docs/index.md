## What are AEAs(Autonomous Economic Agents)?

We define an AEA as:

> An intelligent agent acting on an owner's behalf, with limited or no interference, and whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner.

An AEA represents an individual, organisation or object and looks after its interests and acts independently of constant input from their owner.

AEA's can autonomously execute actions to achieve their goals.

Their purpose is to create economic value for you, their owner, in clearly defined domains. AEAs have a wide range of <a href="app-areas">application areas</a> and we provide <a href="demos">demo guides</a> to highlight examples of their use cases.

## What is the AEA Framework?

The AEA framework is a development suite, implemented in Python, which equips you with an efficient and accessible set of tools for building and running AEAs. 

The framework is modular, extensible, and composable. It attempts to make agent development as straightforward as possible, similar to web development using popular web frameworks such as Django or Flask.

A modular approach to the framework allows the reuse of previously developed components from the entire community, easily equipping AEA's with the necessary components to: 

* Communicate with each other in a decentralised peer 2 peer manner using the <a href="acn">Agent Communication Network (ACN)</a> 
* Interact directly with blockchains as a financial settlement and commitment layer, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>.


## Why build with the AEA Framework?

The AEA framework provides the developer with a number of features, which combined cannot be found anywhere else:

* The peer-to-peer <a href="acn">agent communication network (ACN)</a> allows your AEAs to interact with all other AEAs over the public internet.
* The <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/" target="_blank">AEA registry</a> enables code sharing and re-use by providing a space in which AEAs or their individual components may be shared.
* The framework's <a href="ledger-integration">crypto and ledger APIs</a> make it possible for AEAs to interact with blockchains.
* The <a href="contract">contract</a> packages enable AEAs to interact with smart contracts on various decentralised ledgers.

The (open) AEA framework provides the tools for creating Autonomous Economic Agents (AEA). It is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea" target="_blank">legacy AEA framework</a> that gives no priority to any package vendor.
