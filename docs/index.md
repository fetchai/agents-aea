# Introduction


The Autonomous Economic Agent (AEA) Framework is a software development toolkit which equips you with an efficient and accessible set of tools for building and running AEAs out of components. This framework attempts to make agent development as straightforward an experience as possible, similar to web development using popular web frameworks. The aim is to pursue a goal or optimise an internal utility function. More specifically, an AEA is an intelligent agent acting on an owner's behalf (with limited or no interference) and whose goal is to generate economic value for its owner, by having the ability to interact and participate in alternate types of economic exchange with other AEAs, people, and organisations on its own. In order to accomplish this, an agent usually needs to connect to and communicate with many other services and other agents. Here, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) support the primary settlement and commitment (or smart contracting) layer. AEAs are characterised in programming terms by the software components they incorporate, the data with which they are initialised, and the wallet they govern. Cryptographic key-pairs are kept in their wallet and are used to sign transactions and messages. The framework also offers auxiliary tools and services, including a command line interface (CLI), a protocol generator to generate protocols' code from their specifications, test tools, a registry for framework packages, and a desktop app to run finished agents.

The AEA framework is not the first agent framework. In fact, there have been many frameworks proposed in the literature and multiple implementations exist, but the AEA framework differs from them because of its fully decentralised nature, making it a truly decentralised multi-stakeholder environment with native support for DLT, developers and users of agents. The AEA framework is modular, extensible, and composable and is currently implemented in Python. AEAs achieve their goals with the help of a search & discovery service for AEAs - the simple Open Economic Framework (sOEF) - a decentralised agent communication system - the Agent Communication Network (ACN) - and using Fetch.ai's blockchain as a financial settlement and commitment layer. AEAs can also be integrated with third-party blockchains, such as Ethereum.
