# Design Principles

The AEA framework development is guided by the following 8 principles:

- **Accessibility**: ease of use.
- **Modularity**: encourages module creation, sharing and reuse.
- **Openness**: easily extensible with third-party libraries.
- **Conciseness**: conceptually simple.
- **Value-driven**: drives immediate value.
- **Low entry barriers**: leverages existing programming languages and web protocols.
- **Safety**: safe for the user (economically speaking).
- **Goal-alignment**: seamless facilitation of users' preferences and goals.
