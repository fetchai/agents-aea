An Autonomous Economic Agent is, in technical terms, defined by the following characteristics:

- It MUST be capable of receiving and sending `Envelopes` which satisfy the following protobuf schema:

``` proto
syntax = "proto3";

package fetch.aea;

message Envelope{
    string to = 1;
    string sender = 2;
    string protocol_id = 3;
    bytes message = 4;
    string uri = 5;
}
```
<!--
<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>Additional constraints on envelope fields will be added soon!</p>
</div>
-->

The format for the above fields, except `message`, is specified below. For those with `regexp`, the format is described in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference" target=_blank>regular expression.</a>.

 * to: (`regexp`) `something`
 * sender: (`regexp`) `something` 
 * protocol_id: (`regexp`) `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+:[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`
 * URI: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target=_blank>this syntax</a>

- It MUST implement each protocol with the required meta-fields:

``` proto

    // Meta fields
    int32 message_id = 1;
    string dialogue_starter_reference = 2;
    string dialogue_responder_reference = 3;
    int32 target = 4;
    oneof performative{
        ...
    }
```
 where `...` is replaced with the protocol specific performatives.

- It MUST implement protocols according to their specification.

- It SHOULD implement the `fetchai/default:0.1.0` protocol which satisfies the following protobuf schema:

``` proto
syntax = "proto3";

package fetch.aea.Default;

message DefaultMessage{

    // Custom Types
    message ErrorCode{
        enum ErrorCodeEnum {
            UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL = 0;
            DECODING_ERROR = 1;
            INVALID_MESSAGE = 2;
            UNSUPPORTED_SKILL = 3;
            INVALID_DIALOGUE = 4;
          }
        ErrorCodeEnum error_code = 1;
    }


    // Performatives and contents
    message Bytes_Performative{
        bytes content = 1;
    }

    message Error_Performative{
        ErrorCode error_code = 1;
        string error_msg = 2;
        map<string, bytes> error_data = 3;
    }


    // Standard DefaultMessage fields
    int32 message_id = 1;
    string dialogue_starter_reference = 2;
    string dialogue_responder_reference = 3;
    int32 target = 4;
    oneof performative{
        Bytes_Performative bytes = 5;
        Error_Performative error = 6;
    }
}
```

- It is recommended that it processes `Envelopes` asynchronously. Note, the specification regarding the processing of messages does not impose any particular implementation choice/constraint; for example, the AEA can process envelopes either synchronously and asynchronously. However, due to the high level of activity that an AEA might be subject to, other AEAs expect a certain minimum level of responsiveness and reactivity of an AEA's implementation, especially in the case of many concurrent dialogues with other peers. That could imply the need for asynchronous programming to make the AEA's implementation scalable.

- It MUST have an identity in the form of, at a minimum, an address derived from a public key and its associated private key.

- It SHOULD implement handling of errors using the `default` protocol.
