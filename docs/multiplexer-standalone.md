The `Multiplexer` can be used stand-alone. This way a developer can utilise the protocols and connections independent of the `Agent` or `AEA` classes.

First, import the Python and application specific libraries and set the static variables. (Get the packages directory from the AEA repository `svn export https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea.git/trunk/packages`.)
``` python
import os
import time
from copy import copy
from threading import Thread
from typing import Optional

from aea.configurations.base import ConnectionConfig
from aea.helpers.file_io import write_with_lock
from aea.identity.base import Identity
from aea.mail.base import Envelope
from aea.multiplexer import Multiplexer

from packages.fetchai.connections.stub.connection import StubConnection
from packages.fetchai.protocols.default.message import DefaultMessage


INPUT_FILE = "input.txt"
OUTPUT_FILE = "output.txt"
```

## Instantiate a `Multiplexer`

A `Multiplexer` only needs a list of connections. The `StubConnection` is a simple connection which reads from and writes to file.

``` python
    # Ensure the input and output files do not exist initially
    if os.path.isfile(INPUT_FILE):
        os.remove(INPUT_FILE)
    if os.path.isfile(OUTPUT_FILE):
        os.remove(OUTPUT_FILE)

    # create the connection and multiplexer objects
    configuration = ConnectionConfig(
        input_file=INPUT_FILE,
        output_file=OUTPUT_FILE,
        connection_id=StubConnection.connection_id,
    )
    stub_connection = StubConnection(
        configuration=configuration,
        data_dir=".",
        identity=Identity("some_agent", "some_address", "some_public_key"),
    )
    multiplexer = Multiplexer([stub_connection], protocols=[DefaultMessage])
```

## Start the `Multiplexer`

We can run a multiplexer by calling, `connect()` which starts the receive and sending loops. We run the multiplexer from a different thread so that we can still use the main thread to pass it messages.

``` python
    try:
        # Set the multiplexer running in a different thread
        t = Thread(target=multiplexer.connect)
        t.start()

        # Wait for everything to start up
        for _ in range(20):
            if multiplexer.is_connected:
                break
            time.sleep(1)
        else:
            raise Exception("Not connected")
```

## Send and receive an envelope
We use the input and output text files to send an envelope to our agent and receive a response
``` python
        # Create a message inside an envelope and get the stub connection to pass it into the multiplexer
        message_text = (
            "multiplexer,some_agent,fetchai/default:1.0.0,\x08\x01*\x07\n\x05hello,"
        )
        with open(INPUT_FILE, "w") as f:
            write_with_lock(f, message_text)

        # Wait for the envelope to get processed
        for _ in range(20):
            if not multiplexer.in_queue.empty():
                break
            time.sleep(1)
        else:
            raise Exception("No message!")

        # get the envelope
        envelope = multiplexer.get()  # type: Optional[Envelope]
        assert envelope is not None

        # Inspect its contents
        print(
            "Envelope received by Multiplexer: sender={}, to={}, protocol_specification_id={}, message={}".format(
                envelope.sender,
                envelope.to,
                envelope.protocol_specification_id,
                envelope.message,
            )
        )

        # Create a mirrored response envelope
        response_envelope = copy(envelope)
        response_envelope.to = envelope.sender
        response_envelope.sender = envelope.to

        # Send the envelope back
        multiplexer.put(response_envelope)

        # Read the output envelope generated by the multiplexer
        with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "r") as f:
            print("Envelope received from Multiplexer: " + f.readline())
```

## Shutdown
Finally stop our multiplexer and wait for it to finish
``` python
    finally:
        # Shut down the multiplexer
        multiplexer.disconnect()
        t.join()
```

## Your turn

Now it is your turn to develop a simple use case which utilises the `Multiplexer` to send and receive Envelopes.
