The AEA framework provides the developer with multiple features which combined can not be found anywhere else in the space:

* The **Peer-to-Peer Agent Communication Network (ACN)** allows your AEAs to interact with all other AEAs over the public internet.

* The **Search and Discovery system (sOEF)** allows your AEAs to find other AEAs.

* The **AEA Registry** enables code sharing and reuse by providing a space in which AEAs or their individual components may be shared.

* The Framework's **crypto and ledger APIs** make it possible for AEAs to interact with blockchains. 

* The **contract packages** enable AEAs to interact with smart contracts in Fetch.ai and other third-party decentralized ledgers.
