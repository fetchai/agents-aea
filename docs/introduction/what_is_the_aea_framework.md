# What is the AEA Framework?

The **Autonomous Economic Agent (AEA) Framework** is a software development toolkit which provides an efficient and accessible set of tools to build and run AEAs out of different components. The framework tries to make agent development as easy as possible, similar to web development using popular web frameworks. The aim is to pursue a goal or optimise an internal utility function. This is because an AEA is an intelligent agent acting on the owner's behalf. This can happen with limited or no interference and the goal is to generate economic value for its owner, thanks to AEAs having the ability to interact and participate in different types of economic exchange with other AEAs, individuals, and organisations on their own. To accomplish this, an agent usually needs to connect to and communicate with many other services and other agents. 

Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) support the primary settlement and commitment layer. AEAs are characterised in programming terms by the software components they incorporate, the data with which they are initialised, and the wallet they govern. Cryptographic key-pairs are kept in their wallet and are used to sign transactions and messages. 

The AEA Framework also offers auxiliary tools and services, including:

* A _command line interface (CLI)_
* A _protocol generator_ to generate protocols' code from their specifications
* _Test tools_
* A _registry_ for Framework packages
* A _desktop app_ to run finished agents.

The AEA Framework is not the first agent framework. In fact, there have been many frameworks proposed in the literature and multiple implementations exist, but the AEA framework differs from them because of its fully decentralised nature, making it a truly decentralised multi-stakeholder environment with native support for DLT, developers and users of agents. The AEA framework is modular, extensible, and composable and is currently implemented in Python. AEAs achieve their goals with the help of a search and discovery service for AEAs, the simple Open Economic Framework (sOEF), a decentralised agent communication system, the Agent Communication Network (ACN), and using Fetch.ai's blockchain as a financial settlement and commitment layer. AEAs can also be integrated with third-party blockchains, such as Ethereum.
