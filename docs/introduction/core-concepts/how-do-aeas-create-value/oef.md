The **Open Economic Framework (OEF)** and **Decentralized Ledger Technologies (DLTs)** allow AEAs to create value through their interaction with other AEAs. The following diagram illustrates the relation of AEAs to the OEF and DLTs.

## Open Economic Framework (OEF)

The _Open Economic Framework_ (OEF) consists of protocols, languages and market mechanisms agents use to search and find each other, communicate with as well as trade with each other. As such the OEF defines the decentralised virtual environment that supplies and supports APIs for autonomous third-party software agents, also known as Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs).

  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>The OEF is under development. Expect frequent changes. What follows is a description of the current implementation.</p>
</div>

At present, the OEF's capabilities are fulfilled by three components:

- a permissionless, public peer to peer (agent to agent) communication network, called the <a href="../acn">Agent Communication Network</a>;
- a set of <a href="../interaction-protocol">agent interaction protocols</a>; and
- a centralized <a href="../simple-oef">search and discovery system</a>.

The latter will be decentralized over time.
