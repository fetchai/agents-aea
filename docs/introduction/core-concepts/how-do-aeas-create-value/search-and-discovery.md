## Search and Discovery

A <a href="../simple-oef">simple OEF (sOEF) node</a> allows agents to discover each other. In particular, agents can register themselves and the services they offer, and can search for agents who offer specific services. 

For two agents to be able to find each other, at least one must register itself on the sOEF and the other must query the sOEF node for it.
