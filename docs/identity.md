The AEAs currently use the addresses associated with their private-public key pairs to identify themselves.

To learn how to generate a private-public key pair check out <a href="../cli-commands">this section</a>.

To learn more about public-key cryptography check out [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

AEAs can provide attestations of their identity using third-party solutions. We have implemented a demo using <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Hyperledger Cloud Agent</a> which is available <a href="../aries-cloud-agent-demo">here</a>.
