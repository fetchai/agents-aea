# Vision

Our vision is that the AEA framework enables businesses of all sizes, from single independent developers to large corporations and consortiums, to create and deploy agent-based solutions in different domains, thus contributing to and advancing a decentralized agent economy as envisaged by Fetch.ai.

## Open Source Technology for Everyone

We are creating infrastructure for developers to build their own agent-based solutions.

AEA users include, amongst others:

- Data scientists
- Economists
- Researchers (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems)
- Engineers
- Machine learning experts
- Independent developers
- Students and academics
- Crypto connoisseurs and enthusiasts
- Web developers
