# The Query Language

We recommend reading <a href="../defining-data-models">Defining a Data Model</a> before reading this section.

Along with the Data Model language, the AEA framework offers the possibility to specify _queries_ defined over data models.

The `aea.helpers.search` module implements the API that allows you to build queries.

In one sentence, a <a href="../api/helpers/search/models#query-objects">`Query`</a> is a set of _constraints_, defined over a _data model_.
The outcome is a set of _description_ (that is, instances of <a href="../api/helpers/search/models#description-objects">`Description`</a>)
_matching_ with the query. That is, all the description whose attributes satisfy the constraints in the query.

In the next sections, we describe how to build queries.

## Constraints

A <a href="../api/helpers/search/models#constraint-objects">`Constraint`</a> is associated with an _attribute name_ and imposes restrictions on the domain of that attribute.
That is, it imposes some limitations on the values the attribute can assume.

We have different types of constraints:

- _relation_ constraints:

  - the author of the book must be _Stephen King_
  - the publication year must be greater than 1990

- _set_ constraints:

  - the genre must fall into the following set of genres: _Horror_, _Science fiction_, _Non-fiction_.

- _range_ constraints:

  - the average rating must be between 3.5 and 4.5

- _distance_ constraints:

  - the nearest bookshop must be within a distance from a given location.

The class that implements the constraint concept is `Constraint`
In the following, we show how to define them.

### Relation

There are several <a href="../api/helpers/search/models#constrainttype-objects">`ConstraintTypes`</a> that allows you to impose specific values for the attributes.

The types of relation constraints are:

- Equal: `==`
- Not Equal: `!=`
- Less than: `<`
- Less than or Equal: `<=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Greater than or Equal: `>=`

**Examples**: using the attributes we used before:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType

# all the books whose author is Stephen King
Constraint("author", ConstraintType("==", "Stephen King"))

# all the books that are not of the genre Horror
Constraint("genre", ConstraintType("!=", "Horror"))

# all the books published before 1990
Constraint("year", ConstraintType("<", 1990))

# the same of before, but including 1990
Constraint("year", ConstraintType("<=", 1990))

# all the books with rating greater than 4.0
Constraint("average_rating", ConstraintType(">", 4.0))

# all the books published after 2000, included
Constraint("year", ConstraintType(">=", 2000))
```

### Set

The _set_ is a constraint type that allows you to restrict the values of the attribute in a specific set.

There are two kind of _set_ constraints:

- In (a set of values): `in`
- Not in (a set of values): `not_in`

**Examples**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType

# all the books whose genre is one of `Horror`, `Science fiction`, `Non-fiction`
Constraint("genre", ConstraintType("in", ("horror", "science fiction", "non-fiction")))

# all the books that have not been published neither in 1990, nor in 1995, nor in 2000
Constraint("year", ConstraintType("not_in", (1990, 1995, 2000)))
```

## Range

The _range_ is a constraint type that allows you to restrict the values of the attribute in a given range.

**Examples**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType

# all the books whose title is between 'A' and 'B' (alphanumeric order)
Constraint("title", ConstraintType("within", ("A", "B")))

# all the books that have been published between 1960 and 1970
Constraint("genre", ConstraintType("within", (1960, 1970)))
```

### Distance

The _distance_ is a constraint type that allows you to put a limit on a <a href="../api/helpers/search/models#location-objects">`Location`</a> attribute type. More specifically, you can set a maximum distance from a given location (the _centre_), such that will be considered only the instances whose location attribute value is within a distance from the centre.

**Examples**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType, Description, Location

# define a location of interest, e.g. the Tour Eiffel
tour_eiffel = Location(48.8581064, 2.29447)

# find all the locations close to the Tour Eiffel within 1 km
close_to_tour_eiffel = Constraint("position", ConstraintType("distance", (tour_eiffel, 1.0)))

# Le Jules Verne, a famous restaurant close to the Tour Eiffel, satisfies the constraint.
le_jules_verne_restaurant = Location(48.8579675, 2.2951849)
close_to_tour_eiffel.check(Description({"position": le_jules_verne_restaurant}))  # gives `True`

# The Colosseum does not satisfy the constraint (farther than 1 km from the Tour Eiffel).
colosseum = Location(41.8902102, 12.4922309)
close_to_tour_eiffel.check(Description({"position": colosseum}))  # gives `False`
```

## Constraint Expressions

The constraints mentioned above can be combined with the common logical operators (i.e. and, or and not), yielding more complex expression.

In particular, we can specify any conjunction/disjunction/negations of the previous constraints or composite <a href="../api/helpers/search/models#constraintexpression-objects">`ConstraintExpressions`</a>, e.g.:

- books that belong to _Horror_ **and** has been published after 2000, but **not** published by _Stephen King_.
- books whose author is **either** _J. K. Rowling_ **or** _J. R. R. Tolkien_

The classes that implement these operators are `Not`, `And` and `Or`.

### Not

The `Not` is a constraint expression that allows you to specify a negation of a constraint expression. The `Not` constraint is satisfied whenever its subexpression is _not_ satisfied.

**Example**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType, Not

# all the books whose year of publication is not between 1990 and 2000
Not(Constraint("year", ConstraintType("within", (1990, 2000))))
```

### And

The `And` is a constraint type that allows you to specify a conjunction of constraints over an attribute. That is, the `And` constraint is satisfied whenever all the subexpressions that constitute the _and_ are satisfied.

Notice: the number of subexpressions must be **at least** 2.

**Example**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType, And

# all the books whose title is between 'I' and 'J' (alphanumeric order) but not equal to 'It'
And([Constraint("title", ConstraintType("within", ("I", "J"))), Constraint("title", ConstraintType("!=", "It"))])
```

### Or

The class `Or` is a constraint type that allows you to specify a disjunction of constraints. That is, the `Or` constraint is satisfied whenever at least one of the constraints that constitute the `or` is satisfied.

Notice: the number of subexpressions must be **at least** 2.

**Example**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Constraint, ConstraintType, Or

# all the books that have been published either before the year 1960 or after the year 1970
Or([Constraint("year", ConstraintType("<", 1960)), Constraint("year", ConstraintType(">", 1970))])
```

## Queries

A _query_ is simply a _list of constraint expressions_, interpreted as a conjunction (that is, a matching description with the query must satisfy _every_ constraint expression.)

**Examples**:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Query, Constraint, ConstraintType

# query all the books written by Stephen King published after 1990, and available as an e-book:
Query([
    Constraint("author", ConstraintType("==", "Stephen King")),
    Constraint("year", ConstraintType(">=", 1990)),
    Constraint("ebook_available", ConstraintType("==", True))
], book_model)
```

Where `book_model` is the `DataModel` object. However, the data model is
an optional parameter, but to avoid ambiguity is recommended to include it.

### The ``check`` Method

The `Query` class supports a way to check whether a `Description` matches with the query. This method is called `Query.check`.

Examples:

``` python
from aea.helpers.search.models import Query, Constraint, ConstraintType
from aea.helpers.search.models import Description

q = Query([
    Constraint("author", ConstraintType("==", "Stephen King")),
    Constraint("year", ConstraintType(">=", 1990)),
    Constraint("ebook_available", ConstraintType("==", True))
    ])

# With a query, you can check that a `Description` object satisfies the constraints.
q.check(Description({"author": "Stephen King", "year": 1991, "ebook_available": True}))  # True
q.check(Description({"author": "George Orwell", "year": 1948, "ebook_available": False})) # False
```

### Validity

A `Query` object must satisfy some conditions in order to be instantiated.

- The list of constraints expressions can't be empty; must have at least one constraint expression.
- If the data model is specified:

    - For every constraint expression that constitute the query, check if they are _valid with respect to the data model_.

A `ConstraintExpr` `c` (that is, one of `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `Constraint`) is _valid with respect to a_ `DataModel` if:

- If `c` is an instance of `And`, `Or` or `Not`, then
  every subexpression of `c` must be valid (with respect to the data model);
- If `c` is an instance of `Constraint`, then:
    - if the constraint type is one of `<`, `<=`, `>`,
      `>=`, the value in the constructor must be one of `str`, `int` or `float`.
    - if the constraint type is a `within`, then the types in the range must be one of `int`, `str`, `float` or `Location`.
    - if the constraint type is a `distance`, then the only valid type is `Location`.
    - if the constraint type is a `in`, then the types supported are
      `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `Location`. Notice though that a set of ``bool`` is trivial, so you may find yourself more comfortable by using other alternatives.
    - for the other constraint types, i.e. `==` and `!=`, the value can be one of the allowed types for `Attribute`, that is `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `Location`.

- Moreover, when `c` is a `Constraint`, the attribute must have a consistent type with respect to the data model.
  E.g. consider a `Constraint` like:

``` python
Constraint("foo", ConstraintType("==", True))
```

Consider a `DataModel` where there is an `Attribute` `"foo"` of type `str`. Then the constraint is not compatible with the mentioned data model, because the constraint expect an equality comparison with a boolean `True`, instead of a `str`.
