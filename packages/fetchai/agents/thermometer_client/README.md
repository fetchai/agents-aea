# Thermometer Client

This agent buys thermometer data.

## Description

This agent is part of the Fetch.ai thermometer demo. It uses its primary skill, the `fetchai/thermometer_client` skill, to find an agent selling thermometer data on the `SOEF` service.

Once found, it requests data from a thermometer reading, negotiates the price using the `fetchai/fipa` protocol, and if an agreement is reached, pays the proposed amount and receives the data.
