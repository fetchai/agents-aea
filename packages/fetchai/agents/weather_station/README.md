# Weather Station

This agent sells dummy weather data.

## Description

This agent is part of the Fetch.ai weather demo. It uses its primary skill, the `fetchai/weather_station` skill, to registers its 'weather-data-selling' service on the `SOEF`. This data comes from a database that is populated with dummy data from a weather station. 

It can be contacted by another agent (for example the `fetchai/weather_client` agent) to provide weather data for specific dates.. 

Once such a request is made, this agent negotiates the terms of trade using the `fetchai/fipa` protocol, and if an agreement is reached, it delivers the weather data after receiving payment.
